This directory contains the pipeline for processing several NGS data types.

INSTALLATION
In order for the pipeline to run make sure you have the following directory structure:
/celgene/software/scripts_for_LSF/   : location where the scripts are stored
/celgene/software/NGS_pipeline/:      location where home brew script are located. 


HOW TO RUN 
before you run point the pipeline to the config file you want to use which will contain the explicit 
versions of software and databases you want to use

export NGS_CONFIG_FILE=~/config.sh. The default is /celgene/software/scripts_for_LSF/config/config.sh
source /celgene/software/scripts_for_LSF/config/setEnv.sh

The pipeline is now set. You can run the scripts in the pipeline according to the project you are analyzing.


MAINTENANCE
Currently the software that is used by the pipeline (external applications) is installed in a semi-automatic fashion using masterless puppet.
The manifests for the software are maintained by K.Mavrommatis.
The location of the manifests is git clone https://github.com/kmavrommatis/puppet.git
To install them and apply them type:
$ cd 
$ git clone https://github.com/kmavrommatis/puppet.git
$ puppet apply --parser future --modulepath ~/puppet/modules/ ~/puppet/manifests/site.pp

During the intallation software is installed, the binaries are soft linked to 
/celgene/software/bin and the explicit location of the installed binary is referenced in the file
/celgene/software/scripts_for_LSF/config/config.sh
